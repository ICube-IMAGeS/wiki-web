# Test Wiki


This repo aims at finding a way to host a private wiki. The strategy for now is:
1. host a public repo with mkdocs and Github pages
2. make the docs password protected


## Disclaimer

Note that a majority of the code in this repo has been copied from the excessively great [Equinox repo](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/equinox).
